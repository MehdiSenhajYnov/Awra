# Public style-role catalogue

Style roles let an application keep a GTK behavioral widget while Awra owns
its visual recipe. They are the right tool for data cells, charts and other
domain content; they are not a substitute for an Awra widget that owns
layout, focus, lifecycle or accessibility behavior.

Call `awra_widget_add_style_role(widget, role)`. Awra translates the public
identifier to a private `awra-role-*` CSS class, so an application must never
add the private class itself. Unknown well-formed identifiers are accepted for
forward compatibility but have no visual effect until Awra defines a recipe.

## Current roles

The reference applications use typed widgets for every reusable composition.
PokediaAwra keeps roles only for domain visualizations and GTK data rows whose
model, activation and selection remain application-owned. Its boundary gate
forbids reintroducing the compatibility roles listed below.

| Public role | Expected GTK widget | Purpose | Prefer a typed widget when… |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `data-window` | `GtkWindow` | Data-application root metrics | always use `AwraWindow` for the real window |
| `data-root` | root container | Dense application content plane | `AwraPage` fits the page |
| `app-header` | `AwraHeader` | Compact data-application chrome; header children remain vertically centered | use on a custom start/center/end header composition |
| `app-search` | `GtkSearchEntry` | Header search field | use `AwraSearchEntry` outside legacy ports |
| `sidebar-pane` | sidebar container | Structural chrome plane | `AwraSidebar` owns the panel |
| `navigation-sidebar` | list/container | Sidebar navigation rhythm | use `AwraNavigationItem` for destinations |
| `sidebar-section` | `GtkLabel` | Sidebar eyebrow heading | use public typography for new code |
| `nav-row`, `selected-nav` | row/button | Legacy navigation state | use `AwraNavigationItem:selected` |
| `filter-dropdown` | dropdown | Dense filter sizing | use `AwraDropdown` in `AwraFilterBar` |
| `filter-toggle` | toggle button | Dense filter toggle | use `AwraToggleButton` in `AwraFilterBar` |
| `collection-view` | `GtkGridView` or `GtkListView` | Virtualized collections with a transparent plane, cell spacing and visible focus; GTK retains the model and selection | use when a card or row factory is application-owned |
| `data-list`, `data-row`, `selected-data-row` | list/row | Dense GTK data presentation | keep only when a GTK behavioral row is deliberate; prefer Awra list/data views |
| `category-text` | label | Domain category color | use `AwraBadge:custom-color` when possible |
| `chart-*`, `matchup-*`, `relationship-*` | custom drawing/content | Domain visualization grammar | keep the application visualization |

## Compatibility roles

The earlier Pokedia port used roles such as `page`, `section-card`,
`toolbar-card`, `settings-*`, `table-*`, `inline-toggle`, `contextual-banner`,
`metric-pill`, `entity-*` and `data-meter`. They remain recognized during the
0.x transition so existing consumers do not lose their styling abruptly, but
new code must use the typed replacements: `AwraPage`, `AwraSection`,
`AwraCard`, `AwraFilterBar`, `AwraFormRow`, `AwraListView`, typed button
appearances, `AwraStatusBanner`, `AwraBadge`, `AwraMetricRow` and
`AwraStatBar`.

Neither Showcase nor PokediaAwra uses these compatibility roles. Pokedia's
consumer-boundary test rejects their reintroduction, including calls formatted
over multiple source lines.

## Rules

- Keep GTK models, factories, IME and selection behavior intact.
- Use a role only on the documented widget family.
- Combine at most the state role documented for a base role; do not build an
  application stylesheet out of role strings.
- Use `AwraMaterial`/`AwraSurface` for matter and depth, typed Awra widgets for
  reusable behavior, and public spacing/typography helpers for composition.
- Never inspect or modify private GTK children to make a role work.

## Desktop workspaces

The following opt-in recipes keep file, media and developer workspaces compact
without application-owned CSS. They use the same colors, contrast and motion
preferences as the rest of Awra.

| Role | Expected widget | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace-canvas` | GtkBox | Quiet content plane and chrome separation |
| `workspace-tabs` | AwraTabView | Tabs embedded in compact window chrome |
| `compact-navigation` | AwraSidebar | Dense navigation items with selection feedback |
| `sidebar-heading` | GtkLabel | Muted heading aligned with navigation items |
| `compact-table` | AwraDataView | Compact rows and column headers |
| `canvas-table` | AwraDataView | Transparent column headings on a shared Canvas |
| `pane-caption` / `active-pane-caption` | GtkLabel | Quiet caption and focus indication in a divided workspace |
| `drop-zone` | GtkWidget with GtkDropTarget | Destination highlight while GTK marks an accepted drop active |
| `focused-pane` | AwraToolbar | Subtle focus feedback for independent panes |
| `inline-search` | AwraSearchEntry | Quiet filter in a pane footer |
| `location-search` | AwraSearchEntry | Search that takes over a location slot and keeps its proportions |
| `prose-metadata` | AwraMetadataGroup | Metadata read as text rather than compared as figures |
| `active-tabs` | AwraTabView | Marks the focused view when several views each have their tabs |
| `view-switcher` | GtkBox containing AwraToggleButton | Compact, observable view selection |
| `floating-selection` | AwraSelectionToolbar | Selection actions over content without moving it |
| `inline-edit` | AwraEntry replacing text in a row | Edit in place at the height of the text |
| `inline-action` | AwraButton inside a row | Quiet action as tall as the row's text |
| `usage-meter` | AwraProgressBar under a row | Thin capacity gauge; `awra-usage-low` turns it red |
| `collection-tile` | GtkBox item factory content | Compact icon/thumbnail and caption composition |
| `inspector-pane` | GtkBox | Docked inspection pane, separated from content |
| `document-preview` | AwraTextArea | Readable document surface without input-field decoration |

`document-preview` changes presentation only. Set the public text-view delegate's
`editable` and `cursor-visible` properties for a read-only preview. Use
`AwraHeader:compact` for the matching compact titlebar. Its default remains the
existing spacious header. `AwraSelectionToolbar:clear-label` lets applications
localize or customize the dismiss-selection action alongside their own titles.

Set `AwraHeader:expand-center` when a navigation or address control should fill
the actual space between its start and end controls. The default remains the
centered, natural-width allocation. This opt-in avoids a second navigation bar
and wasted symmetric gutters when the side controls have different widths.
The header keeps its native window controls, drag behavior and Canvas material.

`drop-zone` is visual only: attach a `GtkDropTarget` and accept payloads according
to the application's domain. GTK owns the `:drop(active)` state; the role adds
destination feedback without changing its resting geometry.
