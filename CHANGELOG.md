# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Make the outer window frame square and undecorated by default when maximized
  or fullscreen. Add `AwraWindow:keep-rounded-corners` (default false) to retain
  rounding per application, including live changes and fullscreen with a hidden
  native titlebar. Restoration preserves the configured surface geometry;
  floating controls and overlay chrome retain their own rounding.

- Add decoder-independent `AwraFramePool` / `AwraFrame` for bounded aligned
  RGB and planar YUV storage, immutable texture leases without pixel copies,
  safe producer-to-consumer lifetime, and alpha-correct bilinear previews in
  another bounded pool. `AwraTextureStream` updates multiple
  pictures without per-frame layout or CPU mipmap generation;
  `AwraAspectPaintable` handles non-square source pixels. C, GI and Rust
  consumers cover ownership, color conversion and threaded production.

- Add `AwraOverlayBar` with full-canvas allocation, floating controls, idle
  policy, hover/focus protection and reduced-motion support.
- Add opt-in overlay chrome to `AwraWindow`, timeline-owned pointer previews
  and toast bottom clearance. Dock/overlay transitions preserve native surfaces.
- Fix early window title bindings and full-transfer dialog/palette constructors
  so retained language bindings remain valid after destruction. Transient
  dialogs join their parent's application and support Escape dismissal.
- Forward focus through search, spin, switch and password composites.

- Add the introspectable `AwraTimeline` for backend-independent seeking,
  interval/point markers, viewports, hover previews and cancellable offset edits.
  Keyboard, RTL and `GtkAccessibleRange` semantics are included.
- Add the `collection-view` style role for virtualized GTK grid/list factories.
- Exercise the additions in Showcase, native tests and Python/Rust consumers.

- Windows support: a `win32-dwm` effect backend (Acrylic system backdrop on
  Windows 11 22H2+, accent-policy blur on Windows 10), Windows dark mode,
  accent colour, high contrast and animation preferences mirrored into GTK,
  native DWM shadow and corners for Awra windows, relocatable translations,
  and a MinGW cross file (`build-aux/windows/mingw64.meson`).
- Keyboard helpers map physical keys to the platform's hardware keycodes
  (virtual keys on Windows), so layout-aware legends work there too.
- The command palette shows icons, accelerators and section headings.

- Added `AwraKeyCap`, `AwraKeyboardView` (ANSI/ISO, layout-aware legends,
  selection, roving focus, per-key file drops) and `AwraShortcutCapture`,
  plus public `KeyboardEvent.code` ↔ hardware keycode helpers.
- Added `AwraWaveformView`, `AwraVolumeControl`, `AwraMediaRow` and
  `AwraDropZone` for media workspaces.
- Added toast actions to `AwraToastOverlay` (`show_with_action()`,
  `dismiss()`, `get_current_toast_id()`, `dismissed`); `show_message()` is
  unchanged.
- The safe Rust crate projects the new family and exposes motion duration and
  easing, context-menu and key-code helpers.
- Showcase gains a soundboard pattern and a media workspace built on
  `AwraMediaRow`.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-19

- Added typed page, section, toolbar, forms, application states, filters,
  master/detail and detail-pane composition.
- Added virtualized data views, selection toolbar, advanced inputs, responsive
  bins, breadcrumbs, command palette and dense data components.
- Added accessibility/RTL, hostile-theme, lifecycle, performance and public
  consumer gates.
- Added compositor-neutral diagnostic export and Inspector region/overdraw
  tooling.
- Added generated `awra-sys` and safe gtk-rs bindings with a permanent Rust
  example; all GTK delegate/model signatures are projected and a regression
  gate rejects unsupported generated stubs.
- Added staged packaging, documentation install, Flatpak manifest and CI.
- Added gettext-backed framework strings, installed `gi-docgen` reference and
  an external AT-SPI/Orca bridge audit.
- Made every resolved material field focus-invariant and stabilized hostile
  theme/popup captures at their final rendered state.
- Fixed source distribution so `build-aux` generation and validation scripts
  cannot be excluded by the build-directory ignore rule, while Cargo build
  artifacts remain excluded; normalized dist mtimes make repeated archives
  byte-identical.
- Stabilized the `Awra-1.0` GIR namespace and `libawra-1.so.1` ABI after the
  complete Showcase and Pokedia reference-application gates.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-17

- Initial experimental C/GObject framework, semantic materials, AwraWindow,
  core controls, overlays and `ext-background-effect-v1` fallback backend.
